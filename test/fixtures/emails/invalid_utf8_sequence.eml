Brilliant... thanks for these notes. We'll get onto them now.


> Hi
>
> 1. Main menu -- the "About Us" over state (grey) is a couple of pixels too long.
> 2. The white Search form box needs to be one pixel deeper, to line up with the red button.
> 3. When the submenu opens, can you add a couple of pixels above the first sub-item (eg: Art & Craft).  So that all the [+] symbols are the same width apart.
> 4. The homepage text: "new skills -for work and for life – for all Tasmanians" -- there should be a large dash before the word "for", not a small dash.
> 5. The footer: you need to add some vertical space above and below the content (see attached homepage mockup).

> On the inner pages:
>
> 1. The coloured cells for each of the courses is the wrong colour, and they still have the Sydney Uni treatment -- see attached mockup for the proper colour/treatment.
> 2. There seems to be something wrong with the text "Contact details" in each course box -- far too big.
> 3. When you click the button "Show more courses", the loading box is blue -- it should be either red or beige/browns, as per the rest of the site.

> Thanks for your good work!

> Cheers,
